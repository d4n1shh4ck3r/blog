We are hackers, we are anarchists, we are curious.We like to know how things work. We like to invent, modify and improve technologies like any other hacker. We do it without the aim of money. As hackers we do it for knowledge and to satisfy our curiosity, and we decided to use it in a way to build a better world. Most of us also were rebels in school, and probably got in trouble a few times. We grew up and saw the system as the enemy. We were welcomed into regular hacker groups but we thought they had a limited political education and were still parroting the system's propaganda. The rest of the hackers we knew thought we were crazy joining street protests.
We write,

We love,

We build,

We create,

We destroy,

We emancipate,

We share and

We fight oppression in any form. And of course, we hack.
